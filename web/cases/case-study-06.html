      <!-- Project Description -->
      <div class="col-md-6 clearfix">
        <p><strong>Who: </strong>Greystar Europe</p>
        <p><strong>What: </strong>Recruiting housekeepers</p>
        <p><strong>How: </strong>Print advert in the Manchester Evening News and Metro (Manchester) and online at Fish4Jobs
</p>
        <p><strong>Feedback: </strong>We traditionally use online tools and social media to recruit due to its lower cost and instantaneous nature but there are just some roles and areas where this doesnâ€™t work. Having run 2 online campaigns for Housekeepers in the Manchester area we tried a press advert. The advert reaped a good response and we ended up interviewing eight applicants, five of which were generated by the press advert and three of which were subsequently appointed.</p>
