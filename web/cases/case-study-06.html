        <p><strong>Who: </strong>Greystar Europe</p>
        <p><strong>What: </strong>Recruiting housekeepers</p>
        <p><strong>How: </strong>Print advert in the Manchester Evening News and Metro (Manchester) and online at Fish4Jobs
</p>
        <p><strong>Feedback: </strong>We traditionally use online tools and social media to recruit due to its lower cost and instantaneous nature but there are just some roles and areas where this doesn’t work. Having run 2 online campaigns for Housekeepers in the Manchester area we tried a press advert. The advert reaped a good response and we ended up interviewing eight applicants, five of which were generated by the press advert and three of which were subsequently appointed.</p>
